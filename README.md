#Alex's Portfolio

#Portfolio Overview
### This portfolio contains three exploratory data analysis projects. I downloaded each of the datasets from Kaggle, and I used MYSQL to query the data. These projects demonstrate my knowledge in various SQL topics such as aggregations, joins, subqueries,
     and window functions.
