#In this data exploratory project, I used SQL Lite Studio to a query a database with multiple tables to gain a better understanding of customer and order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderId) = 6
AND orderId <> 'Order ID';


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderId) = 6
AND orderId <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
WHERE order_id IN
   (SELECT orderid
    FROM FebSales
     WHERE length(orderId) = 6
     AND orderId <> 'Order ID');
     
#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product, 
MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY MIN(price)
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT
product,
SUM(Quantity) * price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
product,

SUM(Quantity) * price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

SELECT
location,
COUNT(orderID)

AND orderId <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3; 

#9.How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
